**Title:** *Predicting Human Behavior: From Cognitive Theories and Inverse Models to Centaur and Foundation Architectures for Cognition*  

---

## 1. Background and Rationale  

The study of human behavior has historically advanced through **localized cognitive theories**. Early work focused on models of *Theory of Mind* (Premack & Woodruff, 1978), memory (Atkinson & Shiffrin, 1968), and reinforcement learning (Sutton & Barto, 1998). These models provided precise mechanistic accounts but were narrow in scope and context-dependent.  

By the early 2000s, the field shifted toward **inverse modeling approaches**. Bayesian Theory of Mind (Baker et al., 2011) and inverse reinforcement learning (Ng & Russell, 2000) formalized social inference and goal prediction as computational problems. These models improved predictive accuracy in structured domains, yet they often failed when generalized to novel contexts (Zhan et al., 2019).  

Hybrid efforts such as **BEAST-GB** and **AS-BEAST** (van Opheusden et al., 2020) combined theoretical structure with machine learning, achieving better fit to data but still exhibiting systematic generalization gaps (Rudenko et al., 2020).  

The publication of **Centaur** (Binz et al., 2025, *Nature*) marked a **paradigm shift**. As the first **cognitive foundation model**, Centaur was trained on Psych-101 — a dataset covering 160 behavioral experiments with >60,000 participants and 10M+ trials. Centaur demonstrated:  
- behavioral alignment with human data across tasks,
- partial correspondence with neural activity (fMRI/EEG).  
- generalization to unseen paradigms,  

Centaur and related foundation approaches suggest that cognitive science may benefit from **architectures capable of integrating across multiple tasks and datasets**, complementing rather than replacing existing models.

## 2. Article Structure  

### Section I: Historical Trajectory (3-5 pages)  
- **Localized cognitive theories**: ToM, memory, RL.  
- **Inverse models**: Bayesian ToM, inverse RL.  
- **Hybrid models**: BEAST-GB, AS-BEAST.  
- **Empirical evidence**:meta-analyses 50+ studies showing generalization failures in trajectory/social prediction.  
- **Conclusion**: these models remain essential *building blocks* but insufficient breadth.  

### Section II: Paradigm Shift with Centaur (3–5 pages)  
- **Architecture**: fine-tuned Llama 3.1-70B with QLoRA (~0.15% parameters updated).  
- **Dataset Psych-101**: scale and diversity.  
- **Results**:  
  - generalization across unseen tasks,  
  - robustness to novel participants,  
  - alignment with neural data.  
- **Limitations**: WEIRD bias, lack of multimodality, restricted theoretical embedding.  
- **Conclusion**: Centaur illustrates both the opportunities and the open challenges of applying foundation-style architectures in cognitive science.  

### Section III: Empirical Validation Study (3–5 pages)  
**Research Aim:** Evaluate whether Centaur exhibits both *behavioral alignment* and *interpretive alignment* with human data.  

- **H1 (Behavioral match):** Centaur reproduces human choices in UG, Stroop, N-back, Bandit.  
- **H2 (Explanatory match):** Centaur’s textual outputs semantically align with human verbalizations.  
- **H3 (Latent strategies):** explanation clusters correspond to known cognitive theories (fairness norms, exploration, cognitive control).  

**Design:**  
- Participants: n=50-60.  
- Tasks: UG, Stroop, N-back.  
- Procedure: human participants + Centaur outputs (choices + trial-level explanations).  
- Analysis: GLMM for behavioral data; embeddings + cosine similarity for explanations; cluster analysis for latent strategies.  

### Section IV: Foundation Architectures Roadmap (4–5 pages)  
- **Multimodality**: integrate text, perception, motor, and physiological data.  
- **Cultural diversity**: datasets beyond WEIRD populations (Henrich, 2020).  
- **Theoretical integration**: embedding Bayesian inference, RL, and memory theories inside foundation models.  
- **Ethical considerations**: bias amplification, interpretability, policy impact.  

### Section V: Conclusion (2 pages)  
- Historical perspective: from small-scale models → inverse models → Centaur. 
- Proof-of-concept: pilot study tests both behavioral and interpretive alignment.  
- Future: foundation-style architectures offer a promising complement to classical frameworks, with potential to broaden the scope of cognitive modeling.
