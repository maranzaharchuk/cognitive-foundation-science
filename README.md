# Predicting Human Behavior: From Cognitive Theories and Inverse Models to Centaur and Foundation Architectures for Cognition

This repository hosts the **blueprint and project materials** for a research article that examines the historical trajectory of cognitive modeling — from small-scale theories and inverse models to the emergence of *Centaur* and foundation-style architectures.

## Overview

The project has two main aims:

1. **Historical synthesis**  
   - Trace the development from localized cognitive theories (Theory of Mind, memory, reinforcement learning),  
   - Through inverse models (Bayesian ToM, inverse reinforcement learning),  
   - To hybrid approaches (BEAST-GB, AS-BEAST),  
   - And finally to *Centaur* (Binz et al., 2025, *Nature*), the first large-scale cognitive foundation model.  

2. **Empirical validation**  
   - A pilot study designed to test whether *Centaur* aligns with human data on two axes:  
     - **Behavioral match** (choices, reaction times, accuracy).  
     - **Interpretive match** (trial-level textual explanations vs. human verbalizations).  
   - Tasks: Ultimatum Game, Stroop, N-back, Bandit.  
   - Analyses: GLMM for behavioral data; embeddings and cosine similarity for textual outputs; clustering for latent strategies.  

## Contents

- `blueprint.md` — full 2–3 page article blueprint (historical framing + empirical study plan).  
- `ROADMAP.md` — high-level project roadmap (phases of writing, data collection, integration).  
- Figures (to be added).  

## Deliverables

- Full article manuscript: historical synthesis + pilot validation.  
- Open dataset: paired human–model responses and explanations.  
- Analysis pipeline: reproducible tools for behavioral and interpretive alignment.  

## Target Journals

- *Trends in Cognitive Sciences*  
- *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*  
- *Nature Reviews Psychology*  
- *Nature Human Behaviour*
