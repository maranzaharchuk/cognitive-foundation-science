# Project Roadmap – Predicting Human Behavior

This roadmap outlines the planned phases for the article and pilot study described in the blueprint.  
Current status: **Blueprint prepared and uploaded to Zenodo with DOI.**

---

## Phase 1: Blueprint & Article Draft 
- [x] Drafted blueprint (historical framing + empirical study plan).
- [x] Uploaded blueprint to Zenodo for DOI assignment.
- [x] Created GitHub repository with README, ROADMAP, and blueprint.
- [х] Expand full article draft (background + historical synthesis).

---

## Phase 2: Collaboration & Access
- [ ] **Contact Centaur author team (Binz et al.)**:  
  - Purpose: request guidance on running *Centaur* for both choices and textual explanations.  
  - Offer: share blueprint + Zenodo DOI + article draft outline.  
  - Goal: explore co-authorship or technical collaboration.  
- [ ] Reach out to potential confirmatory co-authors:  
  - **Centaur authors** (Binz et al., 2025) — legitimacy + access.  
  - **Historical modeling experts** (Joshua Tenenbaum, Samuel Gershman, Tom Griffiths) — validate theoretical framing.  
  - **Institutional anchors** (Max Planck Institute, UCL) — strengthen visibility in top journals.  
  - **Experimental psychology PI** — ensure methodological and ethical robustness for pilot data.  
  - **Behavioral data & interpretive analysis expert** — confirm validity of pilot study analyses (GLMMs, embeddings, semantic clustering).  
- [ ] Define roles and contributions for all confirmed co-authors (CRediT taxonomy).

## Phase 3: Pilot Study (Proof-of-Concept)
- [ ] Finalize task battery (Ultimatum Game, Stroop, N-back).
- [ ] Ethics approval and preregistration (OSF).
- [ ] Recruit participants (n ≈ 50–60).
- [ ] Collect human behavioral and verbalization data.
- [ ] Generate *Centaur* outputs (choices + explanations) once access is possible (through collaboration or API).
- [ ] Build analysis pipeline:
  - Behavioral match (GLMM, χ², KL-divergence).
  - Interpretive match (cosine similarity, embeddings, clustering).
  - Latent strategy mapping (expert coding).

---

## Phase 4: Integration & Writing
- [ ] Integrate pilot results with historical synthesis.
- [ ] Draft results and discussion sections.
- [ ] Highlight opportunities and open challenges of foundation-style architectures.
- [ ] Circulate manuscript among collaborators for comments and revisions.

---

## Phase 5: Publication & Dissemination
- [ ] Target journals:  
  - *Trends in Cognitive Sciences*  
  - *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*  
  - *Nature Reviews Psychology*  
  - *Nature Human Behaviour*  
- [ ] Submit manuscript for peer review.
- [ ] Release open dataset (paired human–model responses).
- [ ] Publish reproducible analysis code (GitHub + Zenodo release).

---

## Phase 6: Validation & Community Integration
- [ ] Independent replication: invite collaborators to run the same pilot study with Centaur or related models.  
- [ ] Cross-lab confirmation: coordinate with at least one external lab (cognitive science / psychology) to reproduce results.  
- [ ] Workshop / symposium: present results at a major venue (e.g., CogSci, NeurIPS workshops, Cognitive Computational Neuroscience).  
- [ ] Publish commentary or target BBS open peer commentary format to maximize engagement.
